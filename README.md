# League Item Path Project

Welcome to my league item path project. This consists of what I would consider a full data science process, extracting data from riot API's, wrangling it into ML ready format, and training a model with the data. I started this project with the goal to finally get some introduction to the pytorch framework. While my attempt is definitely messy, I would consider this a successful adventure into this ML package.
